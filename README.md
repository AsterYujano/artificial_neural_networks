# artificial_neural_networks

exercises from Artificial neural Networks course at Chalmers University

You must use Python 3 to run some of these programs and Matlab for others.

### Notes

The code is unclear, there are repetitions, and too much useless commentaries. I don't even look at variable names.
Sorry for the code quality, i ran out of time!
