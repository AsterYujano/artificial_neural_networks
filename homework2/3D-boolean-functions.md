# 3-dimensional Boolean functions

## Question 1

How many 3-dimensional Boolean functions are there?
**256**
Because 2⁸ = 256

## Count the number of symmetries of 3-dimensional Boolean functions that map 4 of the possible input patterns to 1

One symetry with a square.
One with deux points side to side and the others two to the other side.
And 4 for 3 points on the same side and the other point on a different location.
So : 6
