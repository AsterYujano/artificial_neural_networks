# 3-dimensional Boolean functions

## Question 1

How many 3-dimensional Boolean functions are there?
**256**
Because 2⁸ = 256

## Count the number of symmetries of 3-dimensional Boolean functions that map 4 of the possible input patterns to 1

with 4 input as a square there are one symetry by face -> 6 symetries
With 2 inputs in the line 0---0 and the other at the opposite, there are 6 as well


## How many linearly separable 3-dimensional Boolean functions are there?
