# 3-dimensional Boolean functions

## Question 1

How many 3-dimensional Boolean functions are there?

**256**

Because 2‚Å∏ = **256**

## Count the number of symmetries of 3-dimensional Boolean functions that map 4 of the possible input patterns to 1

One symetry with a square.

One with deux points side to side and the others two to the other side.

And 4 for 3 points on the same side and the other point on a different location.

So answer is : **6**

## How many linearly separable 3-dimensional Boolean functions are there? 

* k = 0|8 and k = 8|0 
	* 2 patterns linearly separable

* k = 1|7 and k = 7|1 
	* 16 patterns linearly separable

* k = 2|6 and k = 6|2
	* 24 patterns linearly separable

* k = 3|5 and k = 5|3
	* 48 patterns linearly separable

* k = 4|4
	* 6 patterns and 8 patterns = 14 patterns linearly separable

The total is **104**
